
I created a #kahviraspi channel to divert the related discussions and tests to there. #random should be for random stuff. The coffee answering machine is a bit random so I left it to answer the calls here, like, just in case.

Kahviraspi news: 

	Upgrades:
		Media hosting: 
			The device is such a small and nice tiny tiny lil'a thing, weelywhii--Only accepts a reasonable low amounts of data transfering traffic.  --> Moved the hosting to a nice S3 bucket with a nice Ã¤n-yy-tee-xyz domain. 
	
	The next steps:

		Image manipulation:
			Blurring/spacing out the non-related image areas

		Functionality check:
			Should the image manipulation cost too much for the device stability, arrange the preprocessors elsewhere

		A bot account: 
			After the pics are ensured anonymous, make the bot a nickname to ask the situations without alerting the channel

	The further steps:

		Image recognition:
			Compose / find out a nice Haar classification file for recognizing the coffee pots, analyze the coffee pot area --> estimates of how coffee prepared the situation really is
