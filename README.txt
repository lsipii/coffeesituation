Hi from the coffee situation reporting device maintainer!
The device works so that when someone mentions something coffee 
related on the tamperestartuphub #random slack channel the device
takes a picture and reports it back to the channel. There is a red
light near the lense when the camera is taking the pic. So to say,
this ain't no CCTV! Best brewly regards, lsipii@aarium
