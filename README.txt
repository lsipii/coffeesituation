Hi from the coffee situation reporting device maintainer!
The device works so that when someone mentions something coffee related 
on the tamperestartuphub #coffeesituation slack channel or by directly asking from the
@Coffee Situation slack bot, the device takes a picture and reports it back to the channel. 
There is a red light near the lense when the camera is taking the pic and most of the 
non-coffee related parts of the resulting pic are blurred. So to say, this ain't no CCTV! 
Best brewly regards, @lsipii from Aarium
